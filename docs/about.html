  Hi everyone!<br/><br/>

  I'm Emma, a software engineer, tech enthusiast and woman in tech advocate.
  I first got in touch with coding at school, just a few years before graduating,
  and I immediately fell in love with it. I love being creative with tech,
  solving real-world problems and using the power of technology to make the world a better place.<br/><br/>

  On this blog I'm sharing tutorials for personal coding projects I'm working on,
  stories about working in tech and FANG, and female empowerment learnings.
  Feel free to reach out to me directly in case you have any questions or just want to connect!
